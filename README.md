# Parres

This is the Parres website. It's simple. On purpose.

## Development

We use tailwindcss for styles, and the tailwindcss CLI to build our styles.

To dynamically update the styles as you develop you can run: (this doesn't hot reload the page)

```sh
bun run dev
```

Before pushing minifiy and optimize the output with:

```sh
bun run build
```
